   Every Sketch that uses the PulseSensor Playground must
   define USE_ARDUINO_INTERRUPTS before including PulseSensorPlayground.h.
   Here, #define USE_ARDUINO_INTERRUPTS false tells the library to
   not use interrupts to read data from the PulseSensor.

   If you want to use interrupts, simply change the line below
   to read:
     #define USE_ARDUINO_INTERRUPTS true

   Set US_PS_INTERRUPTS to false if either
   1) Your Arduino platform's interrupts aren't yet supported
   by PulseSensor Playground, or
   2) You don't wish to use interrupts because of the side effects.

   NOTE: if US_PS_INTERRUPTS is false, your Sketch must
   call pulse.sawNewSample() at least once every 2 milliseconds
   to accurately read the PulseSensor signal.

   Pinout:
     PULSE_INPUT = Analog Input. Connected to the pulse sensor
      purple (signal) wire. Ends with index number.
     PULSE_BLINK = digital Output. Connected to an LED (and 1K series resistor)
      that will flash on each detected pulse. Ends with index number.
     PULSE_FADE = digital Output. PWM pin onnected to an LED (and 1K series resistor)
      that will smoothly fade with each pulse. Ends with index number.
      NOTE: PULSE_FADE must be a pin that supports PWM. Do not use
      pin 9 or 10, because those pins' PWM interferes with the sample timer. Ends with index number.
     THRESHOLD should be set higher than the PulseSensor signal idles
      at when there is nothing touching it. The expected idle value
      should be 512, which is 1/2 of the ADC range. To check the idle value
      open a serial monitor and make note of the PulseSensor signal values
      with nothing touching the sensor. THRESHOLD should be a value higher
      than the range of idle noise by 25 to 50 or so. When the library
      is finding heartbeats, the value is adjusted based on the pulse signal
      waveform. THRESHOLD sets the default when there is no pulse present.
      Adjust as neccesary.  Ends with index number.
