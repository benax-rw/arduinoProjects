/*
   Code to detect pulses from the PulseSensor,
   using an interrupt service routine.

   This example is made to target boards in the nRF52 family.
   Install the dependent library. Go to Sketch > Include Library > Mange Libraries.
   When the Library Manager loads, search for NRF52_TimerInterrupt, if you are using 
   an Adafruit or Seeed nRF52 platform. 
   If you are using MBED, like the Nano 33 BLE, search for NRF52_MBED_TimerInterrupt.

   Install the latest version.

   This is a prototype version of PulseSensor_nRF52.ino use at your own risk.

      purple (signal) wire.

      that will flash on each detected pulse.
     PULSE_FADE = digital Output. PWM pin onnected to an LED (and 1K series resistor)
      that will smoothly fade with each pulse.
      NOTE: PULSE_FADE must be a pin that supports PWM. Do not use
      pin 9 or 10, because those pins' PWM interferes with the sample timer.
     THRESHOLD should be set higher than the PulseSensor signal idles
      at when there is nothing touching it. The expected idle value
      should be 512, which is 1/2 of the ADC range. To check the idle value
      open a serial monitor and make note of the PulseSensor signal values
      with nothing touching the sensor. THRESHOLD should be a value higher
      than the range of idle noise by 25 to 50 or so. When the library
      is finding heartbeats, the value is adjusted based on the pulse signal
      waveform. THRESHOLD sets the default when there is no pulse present.
